Cross-lingual Semantic Analysis Report
===================================

1. Similarity Statistics
----------------------
Etymological Pairs:
  - Mean: 0.800
  - Std:  0.057

Control Pairs:
  - Mean: 0.801
  - Std:  0.049

2. Statistical Analysis
---------------------
T-test Results:
  - t-statistic: -0.034
  - p-value:     9.732e-01
Effect Size:
  - Cohen's d:   -0.013

3. Interpretation
----------------
The difference between etymological and control pairs is not statistically significant (p >= 0.05, p = 9.732e-01).

The effect size (Cohen's d = 0.013) indicates a negligible effect.
This suggests that the difference in semantic similarity between etymologically related pairs and control pairs is relatively modest, suggesting limited semantic preservation across languages.
