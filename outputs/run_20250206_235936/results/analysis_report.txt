Cross-lingual Semantic Analysis Report
===================================

1. Similarity Statistics
----------------------
Etymological Pairs:
  - Mean: 0.786
  - Std:  0.135

Control Pairs:
  - Mean: 0.673
  - Std:  0.245

2. Statistical Analysis
---------------------
T-test Results:
  - t-statistic: 1.505
  - p-value:     1.443e-01
Effect Size:
  - Cohen's d:   0.569

3. Interpretation
----------------
The difference between etymological and control pairs is not statistically significant (p >= 0.05, p = 1.443e-01).

The effect size (Cohen's d = 0.569) indicates a medium effect.
This suggests that there is a substantial difference in semantic similarity between etymologically related pairs and control pairs, supporting the hypothesis of semantic preservation across languages.
